# Crochet Diagram Generator (konva)

As the name suggest, this project converts crochet text instructions to its diagram equivalent.

This version is written in HTML and JS, using the KonvaJS library for client side rendering, which serves the purpose of integrating with WordPress better.

This the successor to my previous attempt with turtle, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jaey8den/cdg-turtle).

## Where to find it

This project was commissioned to me by a friend who wants it on her website. I cannot upload everything as it would make the version deployed on her website obsolete. Thus, I have emptied the patterns.js file, which is crucial to generating the stitches.

I have uploaded it here as part of my portfolio. Thanks for understanding!

You can find the generator at [TheLILIPath](https://thelilipath.com).
